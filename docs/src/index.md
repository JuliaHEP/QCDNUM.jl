# Introduction

Fast QCD evolution and convolution.

QCDNUM.jl is a Julia wrapper for Michiel Botje's [QCDNUM](https://www.nikhef.nl/~h24/qcdnum/), written in Fortran77. 
QCDNUM.jl is currently under development and more functionality and documentation will be added continuously. 

All implemented functions are based on the original Fortran implementation. Please see the relevant documentation for further information. 

If you use QCDNUM, please refer to M. Botje, Comput. Phys. Commun. 182(2011)490, [arXiv:1005.1481](https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1481).
